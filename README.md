## Election Audit Summary
This script may be used for any elections in the future in two ways. This file may be saved as another python file and the end-user may go delete the information out of the "election_results.csv" file and copy and paste the new information into the file and run it again. The second way it may be modified by the end-user is, they may save another file in the Resources folder; which houses the election_results.csv file. Save the new csv file with a new name and replace that name in the code blocks that create a filename variable to a direct or indirect path to the file.
